# YOLO-V3_WaggleNet
This project aims at helping local beekeeper to monitor their beehives without checking the bee colonies in person. This program can achieve real-time single object classification when a mp4 video stream is input.
The zip files should be uncompressed and the large weights files should be added when running the code. 
The code is referred to qqwweee/keras-yolo3's github repo: https://github.com/qqwweee/keras-yolo3
The large configuration filese are stored in google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gKiDID2y9DqiVE7ZU7sK6-ICeK6ollE0?usp=sharing
